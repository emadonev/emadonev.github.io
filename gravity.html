    <h1>Gravity </h1>
    <div class="div">
      <h2>What is gravity?</h2>
      <p>Gravity is a force that was first discribed by Sir Issac Newton on July 5th 1687. Thanks to a falling apple ... </p>
      <img src="Images/Astro/Lesson 3/newton.png" class="center">
      <p>Newton probably thought: "Why did that apple fall?" and then went to discover why. He came upon the theory of gravity that claims that: Gravity is a force attracting everything to the center of a object it is on. </p>
      <p>That is why we can stand on Earth and why objects fall to the ground when you let them go. </p>
      <img src="Images/Astro/Lesson 3/gravity.png" class="center-">

      <h2>Fun fact! </h2>
      <p>The force of gravity on Earth is 9.807 m/s^2. So how much is ti affecting you? Well I weigh 30 kg so 9.807 * 30 = 294.21 N ( gravity is measured in Newtons - N )!
      That is the force of gravity affecting me. Give it a try! </p>
      <h2>Movement </h2>
      <p>Now since we know about gravity we need to know how things move. Well Newton did that for us too with his three laws of motion: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"An object will go in the same path forever, until another force acts upon it." </li>
