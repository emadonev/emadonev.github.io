    <h1>Stars </h1>
    <div class="all">
      <p>From previous posts we learned about the beginning of our universe, what
         it is made of and the main force, gravity, that governs it. What can we find
         in our universe? Well the first objects in the universe were the very ones
         which lit it up... </p>
      <img src="sun.png" class="center">
    <h2>What makes a star a star? </h2>
    <p>Well the main difference is that stars emit light when planets and other
      objects don't. But how do they emit light? They emit light because they have
      fusion inside their core. So ermmm... how does that work? A star is mainly
      composed of hydrogen. So when the star gains enough mass the nuclei of
      hydrogen atoms are experiencing so much pressure that they fuse into a
      heavier element, which is called hellium. And every time that happens
      there is a little bit of energy created that is converted into photons
      which then travel, from the star's core, for a long time to the star's
      surface and then further into space.</p>

    <h2>How do we know a lot about stars? </h2>
      <img src="spectra.png" class="center">
      <p>Spectra is the light that stars emit and it si when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors or wavelengths . </p>
      <h2>How does spectra look like? </h2>
      <p>As seen in the picture above spectra consists of all the colors of the rainbow and black lines. </p>
      <h2>What are those black lines? </h2>
      <p>Stars emit two different kinds of spectra: The constant spectra (rainbow colors) and every star has an atmosphere, and it contains elements and those elements absorb the light from the spectra, thus causing the dark gaps. And with the help of those dark gaps we can determine a stars composition.</p>
      <h2>How do we organize all that data? </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In the 1800 scientists classified stars by their hydrogen supply. Then in 1901. a briliant spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon merged and dropped a few of the old classifications and created a new system by more than one element's supply.</li>
        <li>Max Planck, father of Quantom mechanics proved that atoms glow at different colors beacuse of temperature. </li>
        <li>In the end Cecelia Payne Gaposchkin put all the pieces together and formulated a new way of classificating stars: by their temperature.</li>
        <li>The current letters of classification of stars are: O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Including 10 subnumbers according to temperature. Our star is a G2 star, where G is a range of temperature and 2 is in that range a smaller unit providing percision. </li>
